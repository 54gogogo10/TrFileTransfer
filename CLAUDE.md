# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build

```
# From TrFileTransfer/ directory, run:
build.bat
```

This invokes `csc.exe` from the installed .NET Framework 4.x to produce `TrFileTransfer.exe`. References: `System.dll`, `System.Core.dll`, `System.Windows.Forms.dll`, `System.Drawing.dll`. No Visual Studio or MSBuild required — only the .NET Framework runtime (which includes `csc.exe`).

The compiler is C# 5 (max language version supported by the in-box `csc.exe`), but the produced exe runs on .NET Framework 4.5+ (4.6.1 recommended). Avoid C# 6+ syntax: no string interpolation (`$`), no expression-bodied members, no null-conditional (`?.`), no exception filters (`when`), no digit separators.

## Architecture

Nine source files compiled into a single WinForms exe:

- **Program.cs** — Entry point. `[STAThread]` Main that launches `MainForm`.
- **MainForm.cs** — GUI. Mode selector (Server/Client), protocol selector (TCP/UDP), server bind-address dropdown (populated from active NICs), folder mode checkbox (client only), progress bar, speed/ETA display, scrolled log. All UI constructed programmatically (no designer). Language dropdown in top-right corner. Log capped at 500 entries, progress events throttled at ~100ms. Event wiring is extracted into `WireClientEvents`/`WireUdpClientEvents` helpers. When the server completes a transfer, the UI stays in "Listening..." state (not re-enabling all inputs) — the server is still running and accepting new transfers. `ResetClientUI` resets client controls and status text to "Ready". **Monitor mode**: A `_chkMonitor` checkbox enables folder monitoring — `FileSystemWatcher` detects new files, waits for them to stabilize (file size unchanged for 2 consecutive 500ms polls), sends each via TCP or UDP, moves successfully sent files to a "已发送文件" subdirectory. Files not stabilizing within 2 minutes are moved to the back of the queue. Uses `TaskCompletionSource<bool>` for per-file completion tracking without resetting the UI. See "Monitor mode" section below.
- **TransferServer.cs** — Async TCP server. Binds to a configurable address+port, accepts one connection at a time. `HandleClient` reads a 1-byte type prefix and dispatches to `HandleFileTransfer` (single file) or `HandleFolderTransfer` (folder with per-file relative paths and SHA256). Uses `Task.Factory.StartNew(LongRunning)` for accept loop. Sets `NoDelay = true` and 256KB buffer sizes.
- **TransferClient.cs** — Async TCP client. `SendAsync()` for single files, `SendFolderAsync()` for folders. Both delegate to a shared `RunTransfer` wrapper for lifecycle management. Sends file metadata + data + per-file SHA256 hash. Sets `NoDelay = true` and 256KB buffer sizes. The `SendFilePayload` helper is shared by both single and folder transfers. Both `SendFileInternal` and `SendFolderInternal` fire `OnTransferComplete` on success.
- **TransferUdpServer.cs** — Reliable UDP server. Always listens on all interfaces (no bind-address parameter — unlike TCP server, the constructor only takes `port` and `saveDirectory`). `HandleTransfer` parses HELLO body type byte: `0x00` = single file (sanitizes filename), `0x01` = folder file (preserves relative path, creates subdirectories via `Utils.SanitizeRelativePath`). Go-Back-N ARQ. The inner receive loop runs until FIN is processed (not just until all data chunks arrive), ensuring the hash is verified and FIN_ACK is sent before the method returns. If a new HELLO or FolderEnd packet arrives while still in the loop, it is saved to `_pendingPacketData`/`_pendingPacketEp` and dispatched by `ReceiveLoop` on the next iteration — no packet is ever silently consumed. 4 MB socket buffers. Key behaviors: (a) `retryCount` resets on ANY data packet (in-order or out-of-order), not just in-order; (b) on receive timeout, re-sends the last cumulative ACK to help the client recover from ACK loss; (c) if FIN arrives before all data is received, sends ACK(last received) instead of ignoring — this tells the client where to retransmit from.
- **TransferUdpClient.cs** — Reliable UDP client. `SendAsync()` for single files, `SendFolderAsync()` for folders. Both delegate to a shared `RunUdpTransfer` wrapper. Uses sliding window (1024 chunks × 1400 bytes = 1.4 MB window), timeout-based retransmission, Go-Back-N on packet loss. `WaitForAckAsync()` drains stale non-ACK packets and returns when ACK(seq=0) arrives. `SendUdpFileDataAsync()` uses a unified `while(true)` loop: inner data loop sends/receives until all chunks ACKed, then FIN phase attempts handshake; if server ACK reveals incomplete data, loop continues back to data phase without code duplication. SHA256 hash computed once and reused across retries (avoiding double-finalization). `reportProgress` parameter suppresses per-file progress events during folder transfers. Folder transfer pre-computes file sizes into a `FileEntry` struct. `CreateUdpClient()` helper eliminates UdpClient setup duplication. All async methods use `ConfigureAwait(false)` to avoid UI thread starvation.
- **UdpProtocol.cs** — Shared UDP wire protocol constants and helpers. Packet format and types defined here.
- **Shared.cs** — `TransferProgress` class, `Utils` static helpers (`FormatSize`, `ConstantTimeEquals`, `LogTo`, `SanitizeRelativePath`, `GetUniqueSavePath`). All four transfer files use these instead of duplicating.
- **L10N.cs** — Localization strings. Static `L` class with properties that return English or Chinese text based on `L.IsChinese`. See "Localization conventions" below for naming rules.

### Localization conventions

The GUI has a language dropdown (English / 中文) that sets `L.IsChinese`. All localized strings live in `L10N.cs`. Naming conventions by consumer:
- `L.S_*` — TCP server log messages
- `L.C_*` — TCP client log messages
- `L.UdpS_*` — UDP server log messages
- `L.UdpC_*` — UDP client log messages
- All other `L.*` properties — MainForm UI strings

When adding new log messages, add them to `L10N.cs` following these conventions. Never use inline `L.IsChinese ? "..." : "..."` ternaries. `PopulateBindAddresses()` re-reads NICs and updates the first-item label when language changes. Language switch is blocked during active transfers (the combo box is disabled).

### File name collision resolution

Both TCP and UDP servers use `Utils.GetUniqueSavePath` to append `_1`, `_2`, etc. to the base filename (before the extension) when a file or directory with the same name already exists in the save directory.

### Thread safety pattern

All four transfer classes use a `volatile bool _isRunning` flag and `CancellationTokenSource`. UI event handlers are marshaled via `this.Invoke()` in `MainForm.cs`. Local variable snapshot pattern is used before raising events: `var handler = OnXxx; if (handler != null) handler(...);`.

## TCP wire protocol

All transfers begin with a 1-byte type: `0x00` = single file, `0x01` = folder.

### Single file (type 0x00)

```
[1 byte:  0x00]
[8 bytes: Int64 fileSize, little-endian]
[4 bytes: Int32 fileNameBytesLength]
[N bytes: UTF-8 fileName]
[M bytes: file content (fileSize bytes)]
[32 bytes: SHA256 hash of file content]
```

### Folder (type 0x01)

```
[1 byte:  0x01]
[2 bytes: Int16 folderNameBytesLength]
[N bytes: UTF-8 folderName]
[4 bytes: Int32 fileCount]
For each file:
    [8 bytes: Int64 fileSize]
    [2 bytes: Int16 relativePathBytesLength]
    [N bytes: UTF-8 relativePath (relative to folder root, e.g. "subdir/file.txt")]
    [M bytes: file content (fileSize bytes)]
    [32 bytes: SHA256 hash of this file's content]
```

The server creates subdirectories in the save path as needed from each file's relative path. If a file's SHA256 fails, the entire folder transfer is aborted. File name collision handling appends `_1`, `_2` to the folder save directory name.

## UDP wire protocol

Packet header (14 bytes): `magic(4) + type(1) + reserved(1) + seq(4) + bodyLen(4)` where magic = `0x55445054`.

| Type | Value | Body |
|---|---|---|
| HELLO | 0 | transferType(1) + fileSize(8) + nameLen(2) + fileName(N) |
| DATA | 1 | file chunk (≤ 1400 bytes) |
| ACK | 2 | empty (cumulative: highest consecutive seq received) |
| FIN | 3 | SHA256 hash (32 bytes) |
| FIN_ACK | 4 | empty |
| FOLDER_END | 5 | empty |
| NAK | 6 | empty (seq = first missing chunk; client Go-Back-N from this seq) |

NAK flow: When the server receives out-of-order data (detecting a gap), it counts out-of-order packets for the same `expectedSeq`. Only after `NakThreshold` (3) out-of-order arrivals does it send NAK — a single out-of-order packet is treated as reordering, not loss (similar to TCP's 3 duplicate ACKs before fast retransmit). NAK seq = `expectedSeq` (the first missing chunk). The client immediately Go-Back-N retransmits from that seq. Duplicate NAKs for the same seq are suppressed via `lastNakSeq`. Both `lastNakSeq` and `outOfOrderCount` reset when in-order data arrives and the gap advances.

HELLO body transferType: `0x00` = single file (server sanitizes filename with `Path.GetFileName`), `0x01` = folder file (server preserves relative path, creates subdirectories).

Flow (single file): HELLO → HELLO_ACK (regular ACK packet with seq=0) → DATA[0..N] ↔ ACK[0..N] → FIN → FIN_ACK. Window size 1024 chunks (1.4 MB), dynamic RTT-based timeout (initial 3 s, converges to max(4×RTT, 500ms)), max 15 retries. Server only ACKs in-order packets; client retransmits from last ACK on timeout (Go-Back-N).

Chunk size is 1400 bytes to avoid IP fragmentation. An Ethernet MTU of 1500 minus IP header (20) and UDP header (8) leaves 1472 bytes for UDP payload. The 14-byte custom header brings the total to 1414 bytes — safely within a single Ethernet frame. The original 32 KB chunks fragmented into ~23 IP fragments; losing any single fragment dropped the entire datagram, amplifying the effective packet loss rate ~23×. With 1400-byte chunks, each packet is a single unfragmented frame, so loss probability is the true network loss rate.

For folder transfers over UDP, the client sends each file as a separate HELLO→DATA→FIN→FIN_ACK session (one per file) with `transferType=0x01` and the relative path (prepended with the source folder name, e.g. `"a\subdir\file.txt"`) as fileName. The server handles each independently, creating subdirectories as needed. After all files are sent, the client sends a `TypeFolderEnd` packet; the server responds with ACK(seq=0) and fires `OnTransferComplete`.

FIN_ACK is dual-purpose: server responds with `TypeFinAck` on hash match, or `TypeFin` (with 1-byte body) on hash failure after FIN. Client retries FIN up to 5 times.

## Edge cases & exception handling

- `ObjectDisposedException` and `InvalidOperationException` are caught silently in all transfer loops and outer try-catch blocks — these are expected when `Stop()`/`Cancel()` closes a socket while I/O is in flight.
- `SocketException` in UDP inner loops is treated as timeout (retransmit/retry), not a fatal error.
- Bind failure (address not on any NIC) is caught in `TransferServer.Start()` and `TransferUdpServer.Start()` — fires `OnError` + `OnStopped`, UI re-enables controls.
- Language switch is blocked during active transfers.
- `TransferUdpServer.Stop()` calls `UdpClient.Close()` (not `Stop()`) to break out of `ReceiveAsync()`.
- C# 5 does not allow `await` inside `catch` blocks (CS1985). Use a flag variable set in `catch` and checked after the try-catch, or fire-and-forget synchronous `Send()` for non-critical best-effort sends.

### Async/UI thread safety

All async transfer methods use `.ConfigureAwait(false)` on every `await`. Without this, the WinForms `SynchronizationContext` causes every async continuation to resume on the UI thread — starving the message pump and freezing the UI during transfers. The server runs on `Task.Factory.StartNew(LongRunning)` (no sync context), so its awaits do not capture the UI thread, but `ConfigureAwait(false)` is still applied for consistency.

### UDP RTT measurement and dynamic timeout

After sending each window, the client records the time. When the first ACK advancing `sendBase` arrives, it computes `rtt = now - sendTime`. A smoothed RTT is maintained via EWMA: `smoothRtt = smoothRtt × 0.875 + rtt × 0.125`. The receive timeout is `max(smoothRtt × 4, MinTimeoutMs)` where `MinTimeoutMs = 500`. Initial smoothRtt defaults to 750 ms (TimeoutMs / 4). On LAN (RTT ~1ms), timeout converges to ~500ms; on WAN (RTT ~50ms), ~200ms; on high-latency links (RTT ~300ms), ~1200ms.

### UDP timeout mechanism

Use `Socket.ReceiveTimeout` — do NOT use `Task.WhenAny(ReceiveAsync, Task.Delay)`. The `Task.WhenAny` pattern creates a new `ReceiveAsync` on each iteration; when the delay wins, the previous `ReceiveAsync` is still pending, causing multiple concurrent receive operations on the same `UdpClient`. This corrupts internal socket state and prevents retransmissions from being received. `Socket.ReceiveTimeout` integrates correctly with `BeginReceive`/`EndReceive` (which `UdpClient.ReceiveAsync` wraps) and does not leave orphaned operations.

### UDP protocol recovery mechanisms

- **Client FIN-phase ACK handling**: During FIN retries, the client also listens for data ACKs. If an ACK indicates `seq + 1 < totalChunks` (server hasn't received all data), the client jumps back to the data resend phase via `goto ResendData`, re-sends missing chunks, recomputes the SHA256 hash, and re-enters the FIN handshake.
- **Server ACK-on-timeout**: When the server's receive times out, it re-sends the last cumulative ACK (`expectedSeq - 1`). This helps the client advance its window without waiting for its own timeout + Go-Back-N cycle, recovering faster from ACK loss.
- **Server retryCount reset**: `retryCount` is reset to 0 when ANY valid `TypeData` packet arrives (in-order or out-of-order), not only in-order. This prevents the server from giving up while the client is still actively retransmitting.
- **Server FIN with incomplete data**: If a FIN arrives but `expectedSeq < totalChunks`, the server sends `ACK(expectedSeq - 1)` instead of ignoring the FIN. This tells the client exactly which chunks need retransmission.
- **Socket buffer sizes**: Both client and server use 4 MB send/receive buffers (`_udp.Client.SendBufferSize` / `ReceiveBufferSize = 4 * 1024 * 1024`).

## Monitor mode

The client UI has a "Monitor mode" checkbox below the file path field. When enabled:

- **`StartMonitoring(folderPath, ip, port)`**: Creates the "已发送文件" subdirectory, disables UI inputs, starts `FileSystemWatcher` on the target folder, and launches `MonitorLoop` on a thread pool thread.
- **`MonitorLoop`**: Process loop — dequeues one file at a time, calls `ProcessMonitoredFile`, sleeps 500ms when the queue is empty. Exits via `CancellationToken`.
- **`ProcessMonitoredFile`**: (a) Calls `WaitForFileReady` to ensure the file is fully written; (b) creates a new `TransferClient` or `TransferUdpClient` with minimal event wiring (log, progress, `TaskCompletionSource<bool>` for completion); (c) on success moves the file to "已发送文件/"; (d) on failure logs the error and leaves the file in place.
- **`WaitForFileReady`**: Polls `FileInfo.Length` every 500ms. Returns `true` when size is unchanged for 2 consecutive polls. Logs a message every 30 seconds. If not stable after 2 minutes, returns `false` — the file is moved to the back of the queue (so a stuck file doesn't block others).
- **Event wiring separation**: Monitor mode uses its own event handlers that update the log and progress bar but do NOT call `ResetClientUI`. A `TaskCompletionSource<bool>` tracks per-file success/failure — `OnTransferComplete` sets true, `OnStopped` sets false (only the first call sticks).
- **Stop**: Clicking Cancel while monitoring calls `StopMonitoring()` which cancels the token, disposes the watcher, and resets the UI.
